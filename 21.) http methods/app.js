Http methods are kind of request we made to the server.

We are most going to use 4 for our system. They are GET, POST, DELETE & PUT


REST API use this HTTP protocol to send data over computers.

So we already wrote REST API by using app.get, app.post, app.delete & app.put


GET – This is for getting data from server
like – We can get a anime list from server
in express js we use app.get for this type request.

POST – This method is for sending something to server.
Like – We can send form data to server
