/**

To creating quick node application we can use some frontend template engine.

There are many different templating engines

EJS
Mustache
Handlebars
Underscore
Pug
Marko
We can use any of them to do the frontend while making the api.

I’m going to use EJS to show you how to do this.

Start with the official page – https://ejs.co/


You can check the features of it


Installing it is super easy


So finally our package.json
"dependencies": {
    "ejs": "^3.1.9",
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
